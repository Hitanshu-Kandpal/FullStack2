LAZY LOADING is a performance optimization technique, where components are loaded only when they are required. In react, react.lazy and react.suspense, are the two things that are required
to perform lazy loading.

React.lazy allows components to load dynamically

react.suspense provides a fallback ui when the components are loaded lazily.

Benefits :-

		Provides an optimization technique to increase the performance of the website

		Improves page load time
